# Spectra Student

This is a mobile web app myself and two classmates completed in CS 179 @ Harvard: Design of Useful and Usable Interactive Systems. The emphasis of the class was on user testing and design, rather than web development. I've included some of the relevant files in the Design folder.

The purpose of this mobile app is to allow middle school students to record information about their mood and frame of mind each day.
The app works alongside the companion Spectra Teacher web app that allows teachers to easily assess the mental state of their students and incident history, allowing for personalized interactions and informed intervention.
